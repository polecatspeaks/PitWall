## 🗺️ Project Roadmap

We're following a test-driven development approach with clearly defined phases:

| Phase | Status | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| Phase 0 | ✅ Complete | Development environment & scaffolding |
| Phase 1 | 🚧 In Progress | Fuel strategy (consumption tracking & recommendations) |
| Phase 2 | 📋 Planned | Audio playback & message queueing |
| Phase 3 | 📋 Planned | Tyre degradation tracking |
| Phase 4 | 📋 Planned | Multi-class race awareness |
| Phase 5+ | 📋 Planned | Advanced features (profile learning, etc.) |

See [TDD_ROADMAP.md](TDD_ROADMAP.md) for detailed acceptance criteria and timelines.

## 🧪 Testing Philosophy

We follow **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**:

1. Write tests first (Red)
2. Implement minimal code (Green)
3. Refactor while keeping tests passing (Refactor)

Current coverage: **>85%**

## 🎯 Performance Targets

- CPU: <5% during races
- DataUpdate: <10ms per call
- Memory: <50MB total
- Test Suite: <3 seconds

## 💬 Communication
